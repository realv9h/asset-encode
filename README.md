# Roblox Asset ID Encoder

This is a simple Lua script designed to obfuscate Roblox asset IDs by:
- Hex-encoding the numeric ID
- URL-encoding the hex string
- Adding bait characters before and after the encoded string

### Why use this?

While itâ€™s not a bulletproof protection against advanced loggers, this adds a simple layer of obfuscation that:
- Makes the asset ID unreadable at a glance
- Confuses anyone expecting just raw numbers or standard URLs
  
---

### How it works

1. Converts the numeric asset ID to a hex string
2. URL-encodes that hex string
3. Pads the encoded string with random bait characters

The final string looks like a noisy, percent-encoded value that hides the original asset ID.
